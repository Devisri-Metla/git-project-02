Personality Prediction Using Machine Learning 
Personality prediction using machine learning (ML) is an emerging field that analyzes data to assess
 someone's personality traits. It has the potential to revolutionize various fields like recruitment, education,
 and marketing. Machine learning algorithms can process information from surveys, social media activity,
 and even writing styles to predict personality characteristics like openness, conscientiousness,
 extroversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism (OCEAN model). Personality prediction, a crucial area in
 psychology, has garnered significant attention in recent years with the advent of machine learning
 techniques. The proposed systems are Logistic regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Neural
 Networks. Based on the OCEAN MODEL the model predicts the personalities like dependable, serious,
 lively, extraverted.
